## Credentials

Sign up and get API KEY from [here](https://aistudio.oxylabs.io/settings/api-key)

## Compatibility

node was tested against version `1.100.1`.

## Resources

The node includes four resources: Scraper, Crawler, Browser Agent, and Search. These correspond directly to the same applications available in Oxylabs AI Studioâ€™s [web apps](https://aistudio.oxylabs.io/apps).

The parameters are nearly identical to those offered by the official SDKs ([Javscript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxylabs-ai-studio) and [Python](https://pypi.org/project/oxylabs-ai-studio/)).

An additional parameter not found in the web interface is `render_javascript`, which is especially useful for handling websites that rely on JavaScript for rendering content.


## Usage

- Scraper is useful for extracting information from a specific URL without getting blocked.

- Crawler is ideal for scanning an entire domain to collect URLs and their content in order to locate specific information.

- Search helps retrieve the latest information related to a particular query.

- Browser Agent controls a remote browser and can perform interactions, such as logging into an app and clicking buttons, making it valuable for scenarios that require user-like actions.
